# Greenium Browser
[Alpha] - Greenium Browser is a graduation-year project.

## Concept
The main concept is to create an "ecologic" browser guaranteeing both anonymity and security. It contains most of the basic behaviors regarding a web browser, yet it is still in alpha. It includes modules-like systems to allow an extensibility.

## Technology in use
Five technologies in use, the main one is the main application:
• The main UI is in WPF / C#
• The web browser core is CefSharp, based on Chronium
• The application itself is C#

The second part is the web service:
• Golang

Finally, the storage:
• Redis - Server side
• SQLite - Client side
• XML config files - Client side 

Of course, this project is still in Beta
